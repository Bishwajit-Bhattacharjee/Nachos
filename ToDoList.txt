-1. Write test on proj1
0. Report
1. Write on read-only memory should return -1

Testing idea on proj2:
1. join of multiple hierrarchy
2. for loop 10^5 exec and join
3. ram overload ( 5 + process at a time)
4. read write sir's code
5. various exit status and corresponding sanity check


Testing idea on Proj1:
1. join, A -> B -> C -> D , D is on a long sleep
2. speaker listener ( 4 ta speaker, 3 ta listen, long sleep, 1 ta listener)
3. waitUntil (0 time, long time)
